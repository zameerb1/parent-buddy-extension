SHORT DESCRIPTION (132 chars max):
Parental control extension — AI-powered content filtering and screen time management for safe browsing. Controlled via Telegram.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
SafeTab helps parents manage their children's internet access and filter inappropriate content automatically.

Features:
• AI-powered YouTube video classification — automatically blocks inappropriate videos based on title, channel, and description
• Internet access control — enable or disable browsing with time limits
• Telegram bot integration — control everything from your phone using natural language commands
• Channel allow/block lists — permanently allow or block specific YouTube channels
• Watch history — see what your child has been watching
• Adjustable strictness — choose between strict, moderate, or lenient content filtering
• Fail-safe design — blocks all access if the server is unreachable

How it works:
1. Install SafeTab on your child's device
2. Deploy the backend server (self-hosted for privacy)
3. Control everything via Telegram — "allow internet for 30 mins", "block internet", "what's being watched?"

All filtering logic runs on your own private server — no data is shared with third parties. You maintain full control.
